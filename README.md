# crsp

## Overview

This package is an attempt to write some functions for workflows that I
frequently use.

Feel free to use this package, but use it at your own risk.

## Installation

``` r
# Install from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("simscr/crsp")
```

## Usage

``` r
library(crsp)
```

## Notes

1.  Functions I want to add: ~~import~~, mod_sum, knit_to_location,
    ~~frequently used plots~~, rmd template, themes, homa, ~~random
    color palette selector~~
