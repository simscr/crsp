# crsp

## Overview

This package is an attempt to write some functions for workflows that I frequently use. 

Feel free to use this package, but use it at your own risk. 

## Installation

```{r installation,  eval = FALSE}
# Install from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("simscr/crsp")
```

## Usage

```{r usage, eval = FALSE}
library(crsp)
```


## Notes

1. Functions I want to add: ~~import~~, mod_sum, ~~knit_to_location~~, ~~frequently used plots~~, rmd template, themes, homa, ~~random color palette selector~~
